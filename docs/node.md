# Nodejs

Nodejs is installed via NVM (Node Version Manager). This way you have the
flexibility to switch between multiple Node versions.

By default the latest LTS version is installed. This is currently:
`v12.18.2 (Latest LTS: Erbium)`

For more details about NVM have a look at: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
